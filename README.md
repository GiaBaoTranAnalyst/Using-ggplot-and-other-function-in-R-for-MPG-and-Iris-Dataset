# Using-ggplot-and-other-function-in-R-for-MPG-and-Iris-Dataset

## Purpose:
mpg Dataset:

- Calculate the average, median, and standard deviation of the mpg (miles per gallon) variable.
- Which manufacturer's cars have the highest average mpg?
- Compare the average mpg of cars based on their drive train (fwd, rwd, 4wd). Which has the best fuel efficiency?
- Plot a graph showing the relationship between displacement and mpg. Is there a trend between engine displacement and miles per gallon?
- Is there a noticeable trend in mpg across different years? Plot a line graph to visualize any changes.


iris Dataset:

Species Summary:
- Calculate the average sepal and petal lengths and widths for each iris species.
- Using histograms, visualize the distribution of sepal_length for each species. Which species shows the most variation?
- Using boxplots, compare the distributions of petal_width for the three species. Which species tends to have the widest or narrowest petals?
- Create a scatter plot comparing petal_length and petal_width. Is there a visible relationship?
- Based on the dataset, which feature (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) do you think is the most distinct when identifying iris species? Provide reasons for your answer.
